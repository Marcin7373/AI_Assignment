# Dynamic Cowboy Bebop scene recreation 

The scene is a dogfight between Spike in his SwordFish (red jet) and 2 chasing jets.
The scene will involve seeking, pathfollowing, persuing and other AI methods to dynamically 
simulate that fight. The swordfish will mainly follow a path trying to avoid rockets and obstacles
while the attacking jets will pursue and fire those rockets. An important aspect will be the many
different camera perspectives taht will be used from following a target from a stationary point
to being attached to the top of, or the wing of either of the jets to following from different offsets 
by having the camera fly in formation with the target also avoiding the terrain.

## StoryBoard

The scene will start by having the Swordfish folloing a path while the camera flies in formation.

The camera will then switch to be on top of an attacker jet firing rockets with trails at the Swordfish.

![ref3](https://github.com/Marcin7373/AI_Assignment/blob/master/StoryBoard/ref5.PNG?raw=true) 

The camera will the move to a fixed point far away following the action showing the full picture of what is happening
as the rockets follow the Swordfish they will break up into shrapnel when they get close enough as
the Swordfish scans behind it and dodges tehm while following a path.

Another interesting angle will be used by placing the camera following the attacker jet in position
while looking at the SwordFish as the attacker fires a gun allowing the bullets to be followed from a slight angle
from the attacker jets perspective.

The SwordFish will then try losing them by following a path around the pipe shown being approached in the last angle.
It will drop blinding projectiles making one attacker jet crash while the other detaches from the formation and follows on top out of sight.

The SwordFish then flies towards a giant wall avoiding gun fire and more rockets this time shown by having the camera following the SwordFish
in position but looking at the rockets as they fly out of the attacker jet and flipping around watching them fly past towards teh SwordFish.

Then switching to having the camera fly in formation with the rocket while looking at the SwordFish.

The fight will end with the SwordFish getting to and area with water and a bridge and firing at the water before the bridge
making the second attacker jet blind for a moment and flying into an obstacle.
